# Getting started (Python)
Optional: copy the module's folder `gilc` to a location of your choice.

- Make sure that the package is on the Python path by either
  - manually adding the directory (e.g., `sys.path.append(...)`) *or*
  - putting the folder `gilc` in a directory that is already in the `PYTHONPATH` (see `sys.path`)
- Import the gILC module's content before you use it by running
```from gilc import *```

For details check the tutorials in the *examples* folder.
